# Self Evaluation of Arrays

1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

Very good. I have fully mastered this material previously.

2. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

No.

3. What questions do you have about Arrays?

- How does Ruby implement Arrays under the hood?
- Are they implemented as linked lists?
- If so, how does indexing work to give constant O(1) time for read/write operations to access the elements of the array?
- Or are Ruby arrays implemented as hash tables (like they are in JavaScript)?
