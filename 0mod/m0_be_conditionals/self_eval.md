# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

Fully confident. I have mastered this material previously.

2. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

Fully confident. I have mastered this material previously.

3. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

I might need to brush up a little bit on the alternative one-line syntax for `if` and `unless` statements. I believe they are called statement modifiers, and there are like 1 or 2 exceptions where they behave differently than normal `if` statements. I believe it has something to do with how they throw errors in certain edge cases, because the order of the statement and the conditional expression is flipped in the order that they are evaluated by the interpretor.

4. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

Probably about 2 hours, which was a bit longer than I would have estimated. I move slow.

5. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I don't think I need to practice or learn anything in particular with this material so far. I already ironed out a few small gaps in my knowledge, and I feel confident I can continue to do that quickly if anything else comes up.

6. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I did have some questions previously about how the if statements are also considered expressions in Ruby because they evaluate to a value on their own, which can be saved to a variable. However, after some quick googling and playing around with it in replit, I have it pretty well figured out. I also am not aware of any practical reason to use this, but found it interesting.
