# GitHub Notes

To check your own understanding of GitHub, answer the questions that follow.

1. **What is the purpose of GitHub?** Write your response here.

Github is a centralized remote repository. It both saves repositories in the cloud, making them available online, and also simplifies the process of collaborating with other people on the same repository. Before GitHub, users of Git would have to constantly pull changes from every other member they were collaborating with on a repository. The bigger these teams got, the more complicated this process becomes, because there was never any single source of truth for the repository. GitHub creates a single source of truth for a repository being collaborated on. But unlike other centralized remote repositories before it, it still takes full advantage of the benefits of the decentralized, distributed, and local nature of Git for version control.

2. **What is the difference between forking and cloning a repository?** Write your response here.

Forking creates a copy of another user's remote repository on GitHub into your personal GitHub account. So the copy is still remote.

Cloning creates a local copy of another user's remote repository onto your local machine. The copy is on your local machine, and linked to the original remote repository, ready for you to push changes to. This requires special permissions to do, however.

If you do not have the permissions to clone a repo, then you must fork it first and clone it from your own remote copy on your personal GitHub account.
