# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

Nothing in particular. I have already mastered this material previously.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

Good. I have already been using my own note-taking system ever since I started learning programming about a year and a half ago. I use Notion, and I take my notes in a question-and-answer format using toggle lists. This allows my notes serve the dual purpose of quizzes as well to practice using cold memory recall of the information. I take the most helpful notes when I can explain things in my own words, and bring everything out into very clear questions and answers. Adding visual elements, code examples, and any other supplementary information helps as well. It is great when I can forget something that I know I have a note for, look up the note and find it, review it, and be able to quickly re-learn exactly what I forgot before because I understand exactly what I am trying to say to myself in the note.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I am probably quicker to try and solve a problem in my code first than Googling, so if anything I probably could lean a bit more into Googling. However, I think I still do a pretty good job with that too. Maybe on rare occasion I take a bit too long being stuck in the code before reaching for Google.
