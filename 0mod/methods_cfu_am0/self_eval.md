# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

Very confident. I know exactly what to do to get better and memorizing more of them. And I am relatively confident that I can figure out nearly all of them by reading the documentation and doing quick Google searches. I am sure there are some that might be a bit too complicated or obscure for me to figure out, but I think that is probably true for most developers, so I am not too worried about it for now.

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

Very confident. I am very comfortable with my understanding of object-oriented programming as well.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)

Is it okay to just describe standalone methods as functions instead? I know it is against the Ruby convention, but I feel like it is a pretty useful distinction (especially for new people) to identify when they need to use the dot operator when calling a method and when not to.

I guess another question would be why exactly is that a convention in Ruby to call all functions as methods? I am not aware of another programming language that does this (although after looking it up, apparently Java might be the same). In Python, which is very similar to Ruby, they do have the concept of both functions and methods. Do standalone functions automatically become part of Ruby's root/global object (BasicObject), and therefore technically become methods automatically? Or how does that work?
