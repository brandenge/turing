# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

Fully confident. I have mastered these concepts previously.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

It felt fine as I have prior experience troubleshooting things on my own. I did not struggle with the current material.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I probably need to just refresh myself with the common Ruby methods, their optional arguments, return values, etc.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

No questions at the moment. I will consult the Ruby documentation or Google if anything comes up.
