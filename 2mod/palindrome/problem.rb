# A new number is defined as a number that is not a permutation of any smaller number. For example, 859 is not a new number because both 589 and 598 are smaller than it.
# Leading zeroes don’t count, so 30 is a new number.
# Write a function that accepts an integer as an argument and returns true if it’s a new number and false if it’s not.

# leading zeroes
