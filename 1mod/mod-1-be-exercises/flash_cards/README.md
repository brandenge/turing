##  Flash Cards

This is the starter repository for the [Flash Cards](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/flashcards) project. You can either fork and clone the stand alone [repository](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/flash_cards) or work from here.

We will be using this project to practice concepts learned throughout Mod 1.
