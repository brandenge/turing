## Practice Independent Challenges

### Week 2

The week 2 challenge is an intro to Object Oriented Programming. It will require students to build two classes that interact, as well as use an enumerable.

Example: [Potluck](./week2/potluck)

### Week 3 | Midmod

Instructions:
* For the Mid Mod, no tests will be provided. You will be expected to TDD all work (which means creating all `_spec.rb` files and corresponding `.rb` files). See Pets and Customers [README](./week3/pets_and_customers/README.md) for more details.

Example Assessment:
* [Pets and Customers](./week3/pets_and_customers): the entire repository
  * [Iterations 1 - 2](./week3/pets_and_customers/interations_1_and_2.md)
  * Iterations 3 - 4(choose your own adventure):
    * Option 1: [Groomer](./week3/pets_and_customers/groomer.md)
    * Option 2: [Day Care](./week3/pets_and_customers/day_care.md)
    * Option 3: [Veterinary Clinic](./week3/pets_and_customers/veterinary_clinic.md)


#### Additional Practice
For additional practice in a similar format to the week 2 IC, the World Cup challenge will require students to build three classes that interact. It will also involve a more complex enumeration problem that can't be solved with a single enumerable. Students will also need to access a Hash. While a slightly different format than the midmod, this is a good exercise for practice if you finish the practice assessments above.

Example: [World Cup](./week3/world_cup)

### Week 4

The week 4 challenge will involve three classes with only partial specifications. Students must think algorithmically to build an Object Oriented solution that solves the problem. Students will also be required to build a hash.

Examples:
[Boat Rental](./week4/boat_rental) | [Colorado Lottery](./week4/colorado_lottery)

### Weeks 5 and 6

The week 5 and 6 challenges are a test of a student's knowledge of OOP and Ruby mechanics. They will involve two or three classes that interact, iterating over a hash, and several methods that can't be built with a single enumerable.

The week 5 challenge will be a practice for the final in week 6.

Examples:
[Reunion](./week5/reunion) | [Museo](./week5/museo)
