# Lessons

Here you will find the starter code for many of your lessons. Often, instructors will do code-alongs during lessons, and it can be helpful to follow along and take notes of your own.

Each folder is for a particular lesson and topic. Most of these will contain a README to give further instruction on how to best use these resources. Often, there will also be extra practice not covered during lessons in these folders. This is a great first place to look if you feel you need more practice on a topic.
