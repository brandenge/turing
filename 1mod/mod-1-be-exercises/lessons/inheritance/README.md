# Inheritance

These exercises are meant to be used in conjunction with the [lesson on Inheritance](https://backend.turing.edu/module1/lessons/inheritance) at [Turing](https://turing.edu).


## How to Use

Starting with the `lesson_example` folder, read the `README.md` file and follow its instructions. Then, try building more classes and synthesize what you've learned in the `exercise_1` folder.

If you want to see a finished version of the scenarios explored, there is a folder available for this purpose called `lesson_completed`:

In that folder, there are comments and questions for you to answer as you explore the example.
