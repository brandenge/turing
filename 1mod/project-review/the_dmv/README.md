# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

1. Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.
2. What was hard about working with code you did not write?
3. What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?
